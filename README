Complex Form Examples - 2 level nesting
----------------------------------------

Example of nested forms with 2 level nesting.

- We've extracted html chunks into javascript variables in the head to avoid repetition and double javascript escaping (escape_javascript).
- Events work with delegate because it's easier when adding dynamic html parts.
- Most of the javascript is extracted to application.js

Rails is vendored using a Git submodule to official repository:
git://github.com/rails/rails.git

To use it, run those commands sequentially
- git clone git://github.com/alloy/complex-form-examples.git 
- cd complex-form-examples
- git submodule init
- git submodule update (takes a while)
